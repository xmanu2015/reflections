1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
R. Fork is for cloning directly in github, clone is for cloning from github or local to your local, and branch is for make other kind of  functionality in your
repository that could be in local or in github. 

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
R. Help to merge different changes in each local and github repositories.

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
R. Harder, it would be hard to review, commit or merge all the changes.  

6. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
R. Separate branches are better for make anoter function or logic or test experiments that don't affect the master branch, and make
   changes in the master only if we are really sure the our changes go directly and save time.
